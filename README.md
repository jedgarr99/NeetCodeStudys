# NeetCode Study Guide for Software Developer Interviews

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that I've been working on to prepare for software developer interviews. The codes are organized by topics commonly tested in technical interviews, following the structure and guidance from the NeetCode study guide. Some solutions are heavily inspired by or directly based on NeetCode's implementations.
